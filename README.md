In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of connected devices are forming a vast network of information. However, this growth also brings significant security challenges. IoT devices are often riddled with vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to attacks and unauthorized access. This is where blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, enters to change the game.

## Blockchain for IoT Security: Addressing Core Issues

Blockchain offers a decentralized and transparent solution for IoT security. Here's how blockchain addresses core issues:

Immutability: Blockchain stores data in interconnected blocks, forming an unchangeable chain. This ensures that IoT data is securely recorded and cannot be tampered with.

Device Authentication: Blockchain enables the verification of each IoT device's identity, preventing unauthorized devices from infiltrating the network.

Secure Communication: Blockchain encrypts communication between IoT devices, ensuring privacy and data security.

Attack Detection: Any unusual activity within the IoT network is recorded on the blockchain, aiding in the timely detection and prevention of attacks.
